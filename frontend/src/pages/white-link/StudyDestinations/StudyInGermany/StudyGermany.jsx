              German universities offer bachelor's degrees (3-4 years), master's programs (1-2 years), 
              and doctoral programs (3-5 years). The education system emphasizes practical application, 
              research, and industry collaboration. Many programs are offered in English, particularly 
              at the master's level.
            </p>

              The academic year consists of two semesters: winter (October to March) and summer (April 
              to September). German education is known for its rigorous standards, focus on independent 
              learning, and strong connections with industry through internships and research projects. 
              Universities also partner closely with companies, providing excellent networking opportunities.
