            <p>
              The UK education system is known for its quality and structure. Undergraduate degrees 
              typically take three years to complete (four in Scotland), while taught Master's 
              programs are usually one year, and research degrees take 3-4 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              The academic year is divided into three terms, and the teaching style emphasizes 
              independent learning, critical thinking, and research skills. Students benefit from 
              small class sizes, tutorial systems, and close interaction with faculty members.
